Contract 1: DegenGamingToken

README.md

DegenGamingToken
This is a basic ERC20 token contract implemented in Solidity. It allows for the creation, transfer, and management of a custom token called "Degen Token" with the symbol "DEGEN".

Features

Token creation with a fixed total supply
Token transfer between addresses
Token approval and allowance management
Token burning and redemption
Event emission for token transfers and approvals
Functions

mint(address _to, uint _amount): Mints new tokens and assigns them to the specified address
transfer(address _to, uint _amount): Transfers tokens from the caller's address to the specified address
approve(address _spender, uint _amount): Approves the specified address to spend tokens on behalf of the caller
transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _amount): Transfers tokens from one address to another, using an approved allowance
redeem(uint _amount): Redeems tokens for items in the in-game store (to be implemented by Degen Gaming)
balanceOf(address _owner): Returns the token balance of the specified address
allowance(address _owner, address _spender): Returns the approved allowance of the specified address for the specified spender
burn(uint _amount): Burns tokens, reducing the total supply
Security

Only the contract owner can mint new tokens
Token transfers and approvals are restricted to the token owner or approved addresses
Token burning is restricted to the token owner

Features

Counter variable management
Event emission for counter changes
Functions

increment(): Increments the counter variable
decrement(): Decrements the counter variable
reset(): Resets the counter variable to zero
getCount(): Returns the current value of the counter variable
Security

Only the contract owner can modify the counter variable
